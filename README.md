# Swing

*Max 8.5*

This Max for Live MIDI-Device delays incoming MIDI notes according to variable steps within a grid.
The grid always represents one bar in Live.
The steps can be chosen independently of the time signature and subdivision used in Live.
Each step or rather the MIDI notes within the step get delayed by a percentage of the step's length.


The controls are:<br/>

**Grid**:<br/>
   Click and drag to move the steps<br/>
   Option(‚å•) + click resets the step<br/>
<br/>
**Randomize** all steps within the bounds<br/>
**Randomize lower bound** in % of one step<br/>
**Randomize upper bound** in % of one step<br/>
**Reset** all steps to the reset position<br/>
**Reset position** in % of one step<br/>

The interface looks like this:<br/>
